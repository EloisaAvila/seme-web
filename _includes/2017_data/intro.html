                87% of students in Sub-Saharan Africa fail to achieve proficiency levels or reading. More specifically,
                in Côte d’Ivoire, only 53% of adult men and 33% of adult women are able to read and write at an
                appropriate level. The problem is, Côte d’Ivoire is not the exception, but an example of a learning
                crisis across developing countries.

                A growing literature suggests that instead of focussing solely on students, programs should involve
                teachers, who are not only the center but also the solution to the current learning crisis. Focusing on
                teachers' aspirations, rather than needs (Toyama, 2018) could be the key to solving the education
                crisis, which is even more pronounced in rural areas.

                Rural teachers are more gravely affected due to scarce infrastructure and the fact that they are sparse
                and isolated. Innovating teacher mentoring systems as Teaching at the Right level (TaRL) struggle to
                scale what could be a successful tool of improving teachers self-efficiency (Bandura, 1997) and
                motivation, and thus increasing their capabilities to achieve some of their aspirations.

            </p>

                Considering the above, SEMÉ at Carnegie Mellon University hopes to design a successful (feasible and
                sustainable) technological tool to mentor teachers in order to support them in:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    their implementation of TaRL or other teacher professional development methods;
                </li>
                <li>
                    and their attainment of other teaching aspirations?
                </li>
            </ul>
